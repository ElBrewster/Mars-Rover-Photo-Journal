# Mars Rover Photo Journal

This app a server rendered application using Express.js running on Node.js with the EJS template engine library.

My goal for this little project is to show photos from one of the publicly available NASA apis in a fun and pleasing way and to further my understanding of the Express server framework. Since most courses and walkthroughs on fullstack software projects (such as PERN, MERN, and MEAN) rush through the Express portion, I found myself wanting a more in-depth understanding of middleware implementation, the http request and response cycle, and the functionality of the file structure in `routes/views` for creating routes on a site or API paths.

Robert Bunch's course "Just Express (with a bunch of node and http). In detail." was invaluable in helping me create this.
